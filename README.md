## Description

BetterSRBs modifies solid rocket boosters in Kerbal Space Program.  Although some new parts are added, this is really not a parts mod.  The purpose is to fix deficiencies in existing SRBs so that their performance and physical properties are internally consistent and closer to real life.

SRBs continue to have mass ratios comparable to the stock game, but specific impulse has been increased to lifelike values.  Dry masses, fuel loads, and thrusts are computed in a realistic manner based on the physical dimensions of the part.

These changes result in improved SRB performance, both in terms of efficiency and total impulse.  This improved performance must come at a price, so SRBs are now significantly more expensive.  On a cost vs. performance basis, the price of SRBs remains comparable to the stock game.

Also implemented is the use of thrust curves to vary thrust during a burn in a realistic way.  And with the addition of [B9 Part Switch](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=140541), the player can select from different fuel grain geometries to obtain the thrust curve best suited to one's needs.

## New Parts

BetterSRBs adds parts to fill the need for a more diverse range of SRBs in the stock game.  The parts added are just rescaled duplicates of existing parts, though with new textures to give them a distinctive appearance.  There are now 1.875-meter versions of the Thumper and Kickback solid fuel boosters.  Also added is a 1.875m nose cone and a 1.875 x 1.25m adapter.
